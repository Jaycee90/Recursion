# Recursion
Develop and test a recursive C++ function called Merge2AscListsRecur that combines the nodes in X-list and Y-list into Z-list such that, after calling the function, Z-list is a sorted list (in non-decreasing order) containing all the nodes initially contained in X-list and Y-list  â€“  X-list and Y-list should both be empty after the call.
